# Internal interlinking

1. every targeted page has at least one link from another targeted page
1. every targeted page must be reachable through a click-path starting from the start page
1. more important targeted pages have more links than less important targeted pages
1. most important targeted pages have a static link from the startpage
1. ever targeted page must have the chance to get at least once a link from the startpage
1. we only link systematically to the canonical URL
1. we do not link systematically to dead weight
 hidden (i.e.: after user interaction, drop-downs) links do not count as votes
