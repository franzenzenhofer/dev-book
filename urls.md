# URLs

General redommended format for targeted pages is `https://www.%domain-name%.%tld%/%namespace%/%unique-slug%`.

I.e.:

* `https://www.example./a/an-editorial-slug` (recommended for editorial created URLs)
* `https://www.example./v/123456` (recommended for automatic i.e. data import created URLs)

## URL-Rules

* URL-Rule 1: unique (1 URL == 1 resource, 1 resource == 1 URL)
* URL-Rule 2: permanent (they do not change, no dependencies to anything)
* URL-Rule 3: manageable (equals measurable, 1 logic per site section, no exceptions)
* URL-Rule 4: easily scalable logic
* URL-Rule 5: short
* URL-Rule 6: with a variation (partial) of the targeted phrase 

URL-Rule 1 is more important than 1 to 6 combined, URL-rule 2 is more important than 2 to 6 combines, â€¦ URL-Rule 5 and 6 are always a trade-of.

Systematic SEO is not possible if URL-Rule 1 & 2 are not fulfilled.

As measurbility and optimization are two sides of the same coin, the one is not possible without the other. For long term SEO URL-Rule 3 must be fulfilled. 

An URL the fulfilles URL-Rule 1 to 5 i.e.: `https://www.example./v/123456` is "good enough" and can be optimized in a scaling and systematic way. 

A truly search optimized URL must fulfill all URL-Rules.

URL-Rule Nr.6 must never invalidate URL-Rule 1 to 5!
